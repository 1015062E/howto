### Understanding x86 and x86_64

In the world of computers, you've likely encountered terms like "x86" and "x64" when installing software or checking system specs. While they may seem confusing, they refer to the foundational architecture of your computer's processor. Let's break down what these terms mean and how they've evolved.

#### What is x86?

The term **x86** refers to a family of instruction set architectures (ISAs) used by most computer processors today. The name originated from early Intel processors, like the 8086 and 80386, whose model numbers ended in "86." Today, when someone refers to x86, they're typically talking about the **32-bit** version of this architecture.

A 32-bit system uses 32-bit registers, which can process 32 bits of data at a time. A major limitation of this architecture is its memory addressing. A 32-bit system can only access a maximum of 2^32 bytes, which is approximately **4 gigabytes (GB)** of RAM.

#### The Rise of 64-bit

As computing needs grew, the 4 GB memory limit of 32-bit systems became a major bottleneck. This led to the development of **64-bit** architectures, which use 64-bit registers. This change dramatically increased the amount of memory a system could address. A 64-bit system can theoretically access up to 16 exabytes of RAM, though modern systems are limited to a more practical, but still massive, amount. This larger memory space is essential for running modern, resource-intensive applications and for multitasking.

### What is x86_64?

**x86_64** is the **64-bit** extension of the original x86 architecture. It's the standard for most modern personal computers and servers. This architecture is designed to be **backward compatible**, meaning a 64-bit system can run both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. This is a key reason why it became the industry standardâ€”it allowed for a smooth transition from 32-bit to 64-bit computing without abandoning existing software.

#### AMD64 vs. x86_64

You might also see the term **AMD64**. Is it different from x86_64? The answer is no.

  * **AMD64** is the name AMD gave its 64-bit architecture when it was first developed.
  * **x86_64** is the more neutral, vendor-agnostic name for the same architecture.

When AMD created this new 64-bit extension of the x86 instruction set, it set the standard that Intel later adopted. While Intel sometimes uses the term "Intel 64," the underlying technology is the same. Therefore, you can use these terms interchangeably. Different operating systems and software projects might use one name over the other out of convention, but they all refer to the same architecture.
