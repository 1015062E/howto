**AMD64**, also known as **x64**, **x86-64**, and **Intel 64**, refers to a 64-bit processor architecture that was originally developed by AMD. It's widely used in many desktop and laptop computers today.

**ARM64**, on the other hand, is a 64-bit processor architecture developed by ARM. ARM64 processors are commonly used in mobile devices and increasingly in servers and desktop computers.

You can determine whether your laptop is AMD64 or ARM64 by checking the system information. 

#### Method 1: Start command prompt(cmd) and execute below command, then check the output!
  ```cmd
  set | findstr "PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE"
  ```
