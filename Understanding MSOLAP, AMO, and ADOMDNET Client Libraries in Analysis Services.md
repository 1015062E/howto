## Understanding MSOLAP, AMO, and ADOMDNET Client Libraries in Analysis Services

This post explains the architecture and interaction of the key client libraries used in Microsoft Analysis Services: **MSOLAP**, **AMO**, and **ADOMD.NET**. It focuses on the distinction between managed and unmanaged libraries, how MSOLAP acts as a native provider, and how it is indirectly used by the managed libraries. If you're new to this ecosystem, especially from a .NET or SSIS background, this summary can help clarify their roles and usage.

### What Is MSOLAP?

**MSOLAP** is the **OLE DB provider for Analysis Services**. It is a **native (unmanaged) COM-based** component that handles low-level transport protocols and connectivity with SSAS instances. This includes sending XMLA or MDX over TCP or HTTP.

Itâ€™s typically referenced in connection strings via:
```text
Provider=MSOLAP;
````

---

### What Are Managed vs Native (Unmanaged) Libraries?

#### Managed Libraries (e.g., AMO, ADOMD.NET)

* Run under the **.NET CLR (Common Language Runtime)**.
* CLR handles **memory management**, **garbage collection**, and **type safety**.
* Easy to use from .NET languages (e.g., C#, VB.NET).

#### Native (Unmanaged) Libraries (e.g., MSOLAP)

* Built using technologies like **COM** and **C++**.
* No automatic memory managementâ€”**you must handle resource cleanup yourself**.
* Faster in some cases, but more complex to interact with directly from managed code.

| Feature             | Managed (.NET)          | Unmanaged (COM)            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Memory Management   | CLR (Garbage Collected) | Manual (Developers handle) |
| Language Safety     | Type-safe (C#, F#)      | Unsafe (C/C++)             |
| Interop Requirement | No (native to .NET)     | Yes (via RCW/COM)          |

### How AMO and ADOMDNET Use MSOLAP Indirectly

Although **AMO** and **ADOMD.NET** are fully managed libraries, they **do not implement the low-level transport** to communicate with Analysis Services. Instead, they:

* Build XMLA or MDX command payloads.
* Use the **MSOLAP OLE DB provider** through a **Runtime Callable Wrapper (RCW)** generated by the .NET CLR.
* The RCW bridges managed and unmanaged worlds, allowing them to **delegate** network communication to MSOLAP.

This is what Microsoft means when stating:

> "AMO and ADOMD.NET use MSOLAP indirectly."

If MSOLAP is missing or outdated, both AMO and ADOMD.NET will fail to connect.

### CLR vs COM: Key Differences

| Aspect                | .NET CLR (Managed)         | COM (Unmanaged)            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Execution Environment | Runs in .NET runtime       | Native execution           |
| Memory Management     | Automatic (GC)             | Manual (malloc/free, etc.) |
| Error Handling        | Exceptions                 | HRESULT error codes        |
| Interop               | Requires COM Interop layer | N/A                        |

**Example:**

```csharp
// Managed - ADOMD.NET
var conn = new AdomdConnection("Data Source=myserver");
conn.Open();
```

Behind the scenes, this call uses MSOLAP through COM interop.

---

### Connection Flow Example

1. Your C# code calls `AMO` or `ADOMD.NET`.
2. These managed libraries prepare XMLA or MDX.
3. They hand over execution to `MSOLAP` using a **COM interface**.
4. `MSOLAP` sends data to Analysis Services over TCP or HTTP.
5. Results are returned back up through the same chain.

### Important Deprecation Notice

ðŸš¨ **Deprecation of MSI-based Client Libraries**

According to Microsoft documentation:

> The Windows Installer downloads for **Analysis Services Management Objects (AMO/TOM)** and **ADOMD.NET** are no longer being updated and will **not be available after Dec. 31st, 2024**.

#### Action Items:

* Migrate your applications to use **NuGet packages** (`Microsoft.AnalysisServices.retail.amd64`, `Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AdomdClient.retail.amd64`).
* On your SSIS server, check the current AMO version by navigating to:

  ```
  C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_MSIL\Microsoft.AnalysisServices\
  ```

  If multiple versions exist, use the highest one.
* Upgrade to the latest version if needed.

### Final Thoughts

Understanding how MSOLAP fits into the Analysis Services client library stack is crucial for debugging connectivity issues and planning migrations. Even if you're using managed libraries like AMO or ADOMD.NET, you're still depending on the MSOLAP OLE DB provider behind the scenes.

Always ensure the right version of MSOLAP is installed and keep your dependencies up to date.
