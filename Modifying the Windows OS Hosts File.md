In this guide, we will walk through the steps to modify the Windows OS hosts file so that `xxx.yyy.com` maps to the local computer (127.0.0.1). 

## Precautions

Before we begin, please ensure that you have administrative privileges on your computer. Be cautious while editing system files as it can affect your system's functionality.

## Backup Instructions

Before making any changes, it’s always a good practice to backup the file. Navigate to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`, copy the `hosts` file and paste it in another location as a backup.

## Steps to Modify the Hosts File

1. **Open Notepad as Administrator**: Type ‘Notepad’ in Windows search. Right-click on Notepad and select ‘Run as administrator’.

2. **Open the Hosts File**: Click on File > Open, navigate to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`. Change the file type from ‘Text Documents’ to ‘All Files’. Select the ‘hosts’ file and click open.

3. **Edit the Hosts File**: Add `127.0.0.1 xxx.yyy.com` at the end of the file. Save and close Notepad.

4. **Flush the DNS Cache**: Execute this command in Command Prompt or PowerShell with administrative privileges: `ipconfig /flushdns`.

5. **Test the Changes**: You can ping xxx.yyy.com using Command Prompt or PowerShell, and it should return a response from 127.0.0.1.

6. **Retry if Necessary**: If for some reason it doesn’t work initially, ensure that there are no typos or errors in what was entered into hosts file and repeat steps 3-5 again.

**Note**: Always be careful when modifying system files like hosts; incorrect changes can lead to issues with system connectivity and name resolution on your PC.
