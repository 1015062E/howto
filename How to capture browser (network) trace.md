1. Trigger capturing if not (Button color is red means it's running) - by default it's running after opening the tool so no need to do act. Just pay attention if it's not.<br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69a8c532-90bc-42ba-bbcf-5149055e6c48)


1. Then, fill in link in the address bar and then reproduce the issue.  (Just type/paste the URL, you can even start from beginning and do it step by step which is better)

1. Stop collecting after issue got reproduced completely. (By clicking on the red button, so it grey out)
