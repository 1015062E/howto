In this post, we'll explore two essential commands : `whoami /groups` and `gpresult /V`. These commands are useful for gathering information about user group memberships and Group Policy settings.

## `whoami /groups`

The `whoami /groups` command displays the groups that the current user belongs to. It provides detailed information about each group, including the security identifiers (SIDs) and attributes.

### How to Use:

1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
2. Type the following command and press **Enter**:
   ```shell
   whoami /groups
   ```

This command will output a list of groups that the user is a member of, along with additional details.

## `gpresult /V`

The `gpresult /V` command generates a verbose report of the Group Policy settings applied to the user and the computer. It includes detailed information about the Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and their settings.

### How to Use:

1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
2. Type the following command and press **Enter**:
   ```shell
   gpresult /V
   ```

This command will provide a comprehensive report of the Group Policy settings, which can be useful for troubleshooting and ensuring compliance with organizational policies.

## Important Note

To get accurate results, the user themselves should run these commands on their machine. This ensures that the information retrieved is specific to the user's current session and environment.
