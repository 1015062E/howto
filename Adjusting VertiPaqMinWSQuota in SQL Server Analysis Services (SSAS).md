In this post, we'll walk through the steps to adjust the `VertiPaqMinWSQuota` setting in SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to reserve less memory. This setting is particularly useful for managing memory usage in the Tabular mode of SSAS.

## What is VertiPaqMinWSQuota?

The `VertiPaqMinWSQuota` setting controls the minimum amount of memory that the VertiPaq engine can use in SSAS. This setting is only applicable to the Tabular mode of SSAS, as the VertiPaq engine is used exclusively in this mode for in-memory data storage and compression.

## Steps to Adjust VertiPaqMinWSQuota

Follow these steps to change the `VertiPaqMinWSQuota` value in your on-premises SSAS:

1. **Locate the Configuration File**:
   - Navigate to the `Config` folder in your SSAS installation directory. The path is usually something like `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSASXX.MSSQLSERVER\OLAP\Config`, where `XX` represents the version number of your SQL Server.

2. **Open the `msmdsrv.ini` File**:
   - Use a text editor such as Notepad to open the `msmdsrv.ini` file.

3. **Find and Edit the `VertiPaqMinWSQuota` Setting**:
   - Look for the `<VertiPaqMinWSQuota>` tag in the file. (Add it inside **Vertipaq** block if it's Nonexistent)

   - Change the value inside the tag to your desired percentage. For example, to set it to 10%, you would modify it to:
     ```xml
     <VertiPaqMinWSQuota>10</VertiPaqMinWSQuota>
     ```

4. **Save the File**:
   - Save the changes you made to the `msmdsrv.ini` file.

5. **Restart the SSAS Service**:
   - Restart the SQL Server Analysis Services service to apply the new settings.

By following these steps, you can successfully change the `VertiPaqMinWSQuota` value to better suit your system's memory requirements.

## Important Note

The `VertiPaqMinWSQuota` setting is only applicable to the Tabular mode of SSAS and does not apply to the Multidimensional mode, which uses a different storage engine.
