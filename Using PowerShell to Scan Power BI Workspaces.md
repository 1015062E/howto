## Using PowerShell to Scan Power BI Workspaces

This blog post walks through a PowerShell script designed to interact with the Power BI REST API to initiate, monitor, and retrieve results from a workspace scan. The script authenticates with Azure AD, triggers a scan for a specified Power BI workspace, checks the scan status, and retrieves the results.

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- **PowerShell 7.x or later** installed.
- An **Azure AD application** with permissions to access the Power BI API (e.g., `Workspace.Read.All`).
- The **Tenant ID**, **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Workspace ID** for your Power BI environment.
- Administrative access to the Power BI tenant if scanning workspaces as an admin.

### Script Overview

The script performs three main steps:
1. **Authenticate** with Azure AD to obtain an access token.
2. **Initiate** a workspace scan using the Power BI REST API.
3. **Monitor** the scan status and retrieve the results once complete.

Below is the complete script with explanations for each section.

### The Script

```powershell
# Define variables
$tenantId = "your-tenant-id"          # Replace with your Azure AD Tenant ID
$clientId = "your-client-id"          # Replace with your Azure AD App Client ID
$clientSecret = "your-client-secret"  # Replace with your Azure AD App Client Secret
$workspaceId = "your-workspace-id"    # Replace with the Power BI Workspace ID

# Get an access token
$body = @{
    grant_type    = "client_credentials"
    client_id     = $clientId
    client_secret = $clientSecret
    scope         = "https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/.default"
}
$tokenResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$tenantId/oauth2/v2.0/token" -Body $body
$accessToken = $tokenResponse.access_token

# Set headers
$headers = @{
    Authorization = "Bearer $accessToken"
}

# Step 1: Initiate a scan for a workspace
$scanRequestUri = "https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/admin/workspaces/getInfo"
$scanRequestBody = @{
    workspaces = @($workspaceId)
}
$scanResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $scanRequestUri -Headers $headers -Body ($scanRequestBody | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10) -ContentType "application/json"
Write-Host "Scan initiated. Scan ID: $($scanResponse.id)"

# Step 2: Check the scan status
$scanStatusUri = "https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/admin/workspaces/scanStatus/$($scanResponse.id)"
do {
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
    $scanStatusResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri $scanStatusUri -Headers $headers
    Write-Host "Scan Status: $($scanStatusResponse.status)"
} while ($scanStatusResponse.status -ne "Succeeded")

# Step 3: Retrieve the scan results
$scanResultUri = "https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/admin/workspaces/scanResult/$($scanResponse.id)"
$scanResultResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri $scanResultUri -Headers $headers
Write-Host "Scan Result: $($scanResultResponse | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10)"
```

### How It Works

#### Step 1: Authentication
The script uses the `client_credentials` grant type to authenticate with Azure AD. It sends a POST request to the Azure AD token endpoint with the tenant ID, client ID, client secret, and Power BI API scope. The response contains an access token used for subsequent API calls.

#### Step 2: Initiating the Scan
The script sends a POST request to the Power BI `getInfo` endpoint to start a scan for the specified workspace. The request body includes the workspace ID in a JSON array. The response provides a unique scan ID used to track the scan's progress.

#### Step 3: Monitoring and Retrieving Results
The script polls the `scanStatus` endpoint every 5 seconds to check the scan's status. Once the status is `Succeeded`, it retrieves the scan results from the `scanResult` endpoint. The results include detailed metadata about the workspace, such as reports, datasets, and dashboards.

### Security Considerations

- **Client Secret Handling**: Store the client secret securely (e.g., in Azure Key Vault) instead of hardcoding it in the script.
- **Permissions**: Ensure the Azure AD application has the minimum required permissions to avoid overexposure.
- **Rate Limits**: Be mindful of Power BI API rate limits to avoid throttling. Implement retry logic for robustness.
- **Error Handling**: Add try-catch blocks to handle potential API errors gracefully.

### Example Usage

To use the script:
1. Replace the placeholder values (`your-tenant-id`, `your-client-id`, etc.) with your actual Azure AD and Power BI details.
2. Run the script in a PowerShell environment.
3. Review the console output for the scan ID, status updates, and final results.

The scan results can be piped to a file or processed further for reporting purposes. For example:

```powershell
$scanResultResponse | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Out-File -FilePath "scan_results.json"
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Authentication Errors**: Verify the tenant ID, client ID, and client secret. Ensure the Azure AD app has the correct API permissions.
- **Scan Failures**: Check the workspace ID and confirm you have admin access to the workspace.
- **API Rate Limits**: If you encounter `429 Too Many Requests`, implement a backoff strategy with longer delays.

### Conclusion

This PowerShell script provides a straightforward way to automate Power BI workspace scans using the REST API. By following the steps outlined, you can authenticate with Azure AD, initiate a scan, and retrieve detailed workspace metadata. Always test the script in a non-production environment first and follow security best practices to protect sensitive credentials.
