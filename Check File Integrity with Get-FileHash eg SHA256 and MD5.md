## Understanding File Integrity with Get-FileHash

In a recent discussion, we explored the functionality of the PowerShell cmdlet `Get-FileHash` and its role in verifying the integrity of files. This post summarizes our key takeaways.

### What is Get-FileHash?

The `Get-FileHash` cmdlet in PowerShell is a powerful tool that calculates the **hash value** of a given file. Think of a hash value as a unique digital fingerprint. Even the slightest alteration to the file will result in a completely different hash. The basic syntax for using this command is:

`Get-FileHash [FilePath] -Algorithm [AlgorithmName]`

  * `Get-FileHash`: The name of the cmdlet.
  * `"[FilePath]"`: The path to the file you want to analyze (e.g., `"C:\path\to\your\file.exe"`). We used `"C:\MIKESPC\DOWNLOADS\VMware-workstation-full-17.6.4-24832109.exe"` as an example in our discussion.
  * `-Algorithm "[AlgorithmName]"`: Specifies the cryptographic hash algorithm to be used. Common examples include `SHA256` and `MD5`.

### Common Hash Algorithms: SHA256 and MD5

We specifically looked at two widely used hash algorithms:

  * **SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)**: This algorithm produces a 256-bit hash value. It is currently considered a secure algorithm and is widely recommended for verifying file integrity.

    For example, running the command:

    `Get-FileHash "C:\MIKESPC\DOWNLOADS\VMware-workstation-full-17.6.4-24832109.exe" -Algorithm SHA256`

    results in an output similar to:

    Algorithm | Hash                                                                  | Path
    --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    SHA256    | 10FE3A36F525D88AA133118AB3B5A16B18DA88D4AA11B14D74E4164B3FB94BA9 | C:\\MIKESPC\\DOWNLOADS\\VMware-workstation-full-17.6.4-24832109.exe

  * **MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5)**: This algorithm generates a 128-bit hash value. While it was widely used in the past, MD5 has known security vulnerabilities. It's possible (though computationally intensive) to create different files with the same MD5 hash (a collision). Therefore, for critical integrity checks, **SHA256 is generally preferred over MD5**.

    The command to calculate the MD5 hash is:

    `Get-FileHash "C:\MIKESPC\DOWNLOADS\VMware-workstation-full-17.6.4-24832109.exe" -Algorithm MD5`

    This would produce output like:

    Algorithm | Hash                                  | Path
    --------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    MD5       | B387E0A655798BA356D9A7331D98851A    | C:\\MIKESPC\\DOWNLOADS\\VMware-workstation-full-17.6.4-24832109.exe

### Why Use File Hashing?

The primary reason to use file hashing is to **verify file integrity**. This is crucial in several scenarios:

  * **Download Verification**: When downloading files from the internet, you can compare the calculated hash of the downloaded file with the hash provided by the source. If the hashes match, it confirms that the file was downloaded completely and without errors or malicious modifications.
  * **Detecting Tampering**: Hashing can be used to create a baseline hash for important files. If you suspect a file has been altered, you can recalculate its hash and compare it to the baseline. A mismatch indicates that the file has been modified.

In summary, `Get-FileHash` is a valuable tool for ensuring the files you have are the same as the original, providing a level of confidence in their integrity.
