## How to Find Your Power BI or Fabric Administrator

When you need access to specific content in Power BI—such as a workspace, dataset, or admin-level features—you may be advised to contact your Power BI administrator. However, it's not always obvious who that person is within your organization. This blog post provides a clear and safe process for identifying your Power BI or Fabric administrator using either the Microsoft 365 Admin Center or the Microsoft Entra (Azure Active Directory) portal.

### What Is a Fabric Administrator?

As of June 2023, Microsoft renamed the "Power BI Service Administrator" role to **Fabric Administrator** to reflect its broader scope across Microsoft Fabric. Users with this role can manage tenant-wide settings in the Power BI service, access the Admin Portal, monitor usage, and manage governance features across Microsoft Fabric.

If you need someone to grant you workspace access or update tenant settings, this is the role they must hold.

### Method 1: Use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center

If you (or someone on your IT team) has a Global or Privileged Role Administrator account in Microsoft 365, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com) using admin credentials.
2. In the left-hand menu, select **Roles**, then click **Role assignments**.
3. In the list of roles, search for **Fabric Administrator**.
4. Click the **Fabric Administrator** role and open the **Assigned** tab.
5. Review the list of users and groups with this role.

> **Note**: If you do not have access to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, share these steps with your IT helpdesk or internal admin team.

### Method 2: Use Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) Portal

This method can also be used by IT administrators to locate users or groups with the Fabric Administrator role:

1. Go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with a directory-level admin account.
2. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** → **Roles and administrators**.
3. Search for and select the **Fabric Administrator** role.
4. Under the **Active assignments** section, you’ll see all users or groups currently assigned.

This method provides the same outcome as the Microsoft 365 Admin Center but may be preferred by organizations managing identity through Azure Active Directory.

### Optional: Confirm Admin Privileges in Power BI

If you believe you are (or someone else is) a Power BI/Fabric admin and want to confirm it:

1. Sign in to [https://app.powerbi.com](https://app.powerbi.com).
2. Click the ⚙️ **Settings** icon and select **Admin portal**.
3. If you see full sections such as **Tenant settings**, **Audit logs**, and **Usage metrics**, you are an admin.
4. If you only see **Capacity settings**, you are **not** an admin.

### Next Steps

- **If you are a user** trying to gain access to Power BI content, send these instructions to your IT or Microsoft 365 administrator.
- **If you are an admin** receiving this request, use the methods above to identify the Fabric Administrators in your tenant.
- Once identified, contact the appropriate administrator to request access or configuration changes.

### Placeholder Notice

> Replace all organization-specific details with your actual company or department names. For example, "contact your IT team" may refer to "contact the [YourOrg] IT Service Desk."
