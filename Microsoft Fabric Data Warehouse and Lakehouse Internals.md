## Understanding Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse and Lakehouse Internals

In this blog post, we’ll demystify how **Microsoft Fabric’s Data Warehouse** works under the hood, how it compares to **Lakehouse**, what **Delta and Parquet files** really are, and when to use which option. This is targeted toward users getting started with Microsoft Fabric and feeling confused about these core storage and analytics concepts.

---

### What Is Structured, Semi-structured, and Unstructured Data?

Before diving into Fabric components, let’s clarify the types of data we deal with:

| Type            | Description                                     | Examples                        |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Structured      | Tabular data with schema                        | SQL tables, Excel, CSV          |
| Semi-structured | Has structure but not fixed tables              | JSON, XML, logs                 |
| Unstructured    | No clear format or schema                       | Images, videos, PDFs, emails    |

Fabric supports all of these, but each workload is optimized for different types.

### Overview: What Is Fabric Data Warehouse?

The **Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse** is a cloud-native, scalable, analytical SQL engine built on top of **Delta Parquet files** stored in **OneLake**. It looks like a classic relational database to users (via T-SQL), but behaves very differently under the hood.

#### Key Characteristics

- SQL-first interface (T-SQL compatible)
- Tables backed by **Delta Parquet** files in OneLake
- Optimized for BI, reporting, and dashboard workloads
- Cloud-native, distributed architecture (not SQL Server)

---

### How Does It Work Under the Hood?

Here's a breakdown of what happens behind the scenes:

#### 1. Storage Layer: Delta Parquet in OneLake

- **Parquet**: Columnar, compressed file format optimized for analytical reads.
- **Delta**: Adds ACID transactions, versioning, schema enforcement.
- **OneLake**: The unified data lake in Microsoft Fabric where all data is stored.

Each table in the Data Warehouse is really a **Delta Lake table**, stored as a set of **Parquet files** with transaction logs.

#### 2. SQL Engine

Fabric uses a **cloud-native, distributed SQL engine** that:

- Accepts and parses T-SQL queries
- Uses a **distributed query plan** (similar to MPP engines)
- Reads from Delta Parquet files
- Caches and executes tasks across nodes in parallel

#### 3. Metadata Layer

Fabric tracks:

- Table schema and data types
- Primary/foreign keys
- Query optimization statistics
- Delta transaction logs

This metadata allows the system to resolve schema and manage updates without traditional database files.

#### 4. Query Flow

```text
[User Query (T-SQL)]
       ↓
   SQL Parser & Optimizer
       ↓
   Metadata Lookup (Schema, Files)
       ↓
   Query Plan Creation
       ↓
   Parallel Execution on Compute Nodes
       ↓
   Reads Delta Parquet Files from OneLake
       ↓
   Combines & Returns Results
````

#### 5. Write Flow

```sql
INSERT INTO Sales VALUES (...)
```

* New data is appended as Parquet files.
* Delta transaction log is updated.
* ACID guarantees ensure consistent reads and isolation.

### Delta vs. Parquet – What's the Difference?

| Feature         | Parquet              | Delta (on Parquet)              |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Format          | Columnar file format | Built on top of Parquet         |
| ACID Support    | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                           |
| Versioning      | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes (time travel)             |
| Updates/Deletes | ❌ Not efficient      | ✅ Supported via transaction log |
| Used In         | Raw lake files       | Lakehouse, Warehouse            |

### Fabric Lakehouse vs. Data Warehouse

They seem similar, but are optimized for different personas and workflows.

| Feature              | Data Warehouse                 | Lakehouse                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| User Focus           | BI Analysts, Report Developers | Data Engineers, ML/AI Teams            |
| Query Language       | T-SQL                          | SQL, PySpark, Notebooks                |
| Storage Format       | Delta Parquet                  | Delta Parquet                          |
| Use Case             | Fast Power BI dashboards       | Ingesting, processing raw/complex data |
| Compute Engine       | Distributed SQL engine         | Spark engine                           |
| Tooling              | SQL Editor, Power BI           | Notebooks, Pipelines, Wrangler         |
| Data Types Supported | Structured only                | Structured, semi-, and unstructured    |

#### Typical Flow:

```
Raw data → Lakehouse → Transform with Notebooks → Load into Warehouse → Power BI reports
```

### What About Power BI Dataflows?

Power BI Dataflows may feel similar to Warehouses, but they are fundamentally different:

| Feature      | Dataflows              | Fabric Data Warehouse              |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Language     | Power Query (M)        | T-SQL                              |
| Purpose      | ETL and transformation | Long-term storage + fast analytics |
| Storage      | CSV-like in cloud      | Delta Parquet in OneLake           |
| Performance  | Lightweight            | Enterprise-grade, MPP architecture |
| Suitable For | Small data prep        | Large-scale reporting              |

---

### Summary: When to Use What?

| Scenario                                    | Use                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Need high-speed dashboards with SQL         | ✅ Data Warehouse              |
| Have lots of raw data (JSON, logs, etc.)    | ✅ Lakehouse                   |
| Doing machine learning / Spark workloads    | ✅ Lakehouse                   |
| Want simple ETL for Power BI                | ✅ Dataflows                   |
| Building a data lake to serve multiple uses | ✅ Lakehouse + Warehouse combo |

### Final Thoughts

Microsoft Fabric brings together the flexibility of a data lake with the familiarity of SQL and BI tooling. Understanding the **underlying file-based architecture** (Delta + Parquet in OneLake) helps you:

* Optimize performance
* Choose the right workload
* Design efficient data models

> Even though the **Data Warehouse feels like SQL Server**, it's fundamentally a **cloud-native system built for scale**, running on distributed compute and file storage.
