# How to Check the Security Zone of a Website

Internet Explorer is a web browser that allows you to browse the internet and access various websites. However, not all websites are equally trustworthy or secure. Some websites may contain malicious content or try to steal your personal information. To protect your computer and data, Internet Explorer assigns different security zones to different websites based on their level of trustworthiness and security. The security zones are:

- **Internet**: This is the default zone for all websites that are not in any other zone. It has the most restrictive settings to prevent potential harm from untrusted websites.
- **Local intranet**: This is the zone for websites that are on your local network or your organization's network. It has less restrictive settings than the Internet zone, as these websites are considered more trustworthy.
- **Trusted sites**: This is the zone for websites that you trust and want to allow more features and functionality. You can add websites to this zone manually or through a group policy. It has less restrictive settings than the Local intranet zone, as these websites are considered very trustworthy.
- **Restricted sites**: This is the zone for websites that you do not trust and want to block or limit their access to your computer. You can add websites to this zone manually or through a group policy. It has the most restrictive settings of all zones, as these websites are considered very untrustworthy.

Knowing which security zone a website belongs to can help you decide whether to visit it or not, and how to adjust your browser settings accordingly. In this blog post, I will show you two methods of checking the security zone of a website in Internet Explorer.

## Method 1: Right-click on a blank area of the webpage and select "Properties"

This is a quick and easy way to check the security zone of a website in Internet Explorer. Here are the steps:

1. Open Internet Explorer and navigate to the website you want to check.
2. Right-click on a blank area of the webpage. Please make sure it's a blank area, as some websites may have right-clicking disabled or have interactive elements that might interfere.
3. From the context menu that appears, select "Properties".
4. A dialog box will appear. Under the "General" tab, look for the "Zone" field. This will tell you which security zone the website is in (Internet, Local intranet, Trusted sites, etc.).

Please note that this method may not work in all cases as the determination of security zones can be complex and depend on various factors such as your network configuration and system policies. If you're unable to see the "Properties" option in the context menu, it could be due to specific website settings or browser configurations. In such cases, you might need to try a different method or browser.

## Method 2: Use PowerShell command

This is a more advanced way to check the security zone of a website in Internet Explorer using PowerShell, which is a scripting language and command-line tool for Windows. Here are the steps:

1. Open PowerShell by typing "powershell" in the Start menu search box and clicking on it.
2. In PowerShell, type ```[System.Security.Policy.Zone]::CreateFromUrl('URL')```, where `URL` is the website address you want to check. For example, `[System.Security.Policy.Zone]::CreateFromUrl('https://www.google.com/')`.
3. Press Enter. PowerShell will return the security zone of the website as one of these values: `MyComputer`, `Intranet`, `Trusted`, `Internet`, or `Untrusted`.

Please note that this method may not work in all cases as well, as PowerShell may not have access to some system policies or network configurations that affect the security zones. If you're unsure about using PowerShell or encounter any errors, you might need to consult an IT professional or use a different method or browser.
