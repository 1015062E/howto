## Understanding OAuth OIDC and OpenID

A coherent identity solution often involves three related standards: OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and the original OpenID protocol. OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that lets applications obtain limited access to protected resources without exposing user credentials ([IETF Datatracker][1]). OpenID Connect builds on OAuth 2.0 by adding an authentication layer, issuing a signed JSON Web Token (ID Token) that confirms a user’s identity ([OpenID Foundation][2], [OpenID Foundation][3]). Classic OpenID is a decentralized authentication protocol predating OIDC, allowing users to log in across sites using a single chosen Identity Provider (IDP) ([OpenID Foundation][4], [Wikipedia][5]). Together, these standards enable secure, interoperable, and user-friendly Single Sign-On (SSO) experiences across web and mobile applications.

### What Is OAuth 2.0?

OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard framework for authorization, defined in RFC 6749. It allows third-party applications to obtain **limited** access to HTTP services on behalf of a resource owner without sharing credentials ([IETF Datatracker][1]). The framework describes multiple grant types (flows) such as Authorization Code, Implicit, Resource Owner Password Credentials, and Client Credentials, each suited to different client scenarios ([OAuth Community Site][6]). OAuth 2.0 focuses on developer simplicity while enabling fine-grained access control to APIs and resources ([OAuth Community Site][6]).

#### Core Concepts

* **Resource Owner**: Typically, the end user who owns the data.
* **Client**: The application requesting access.
* **Authorization Server**: Issues access tokens after authenticating the resource owner.
* **Resource Server**: Hosts protected resources and accepts access tokens. ([IETF Datatracker][1]).

### What Is OpenID Connect (OIDC)?

OpenID Connect is a **simple identity layer** on top of OAuth 2.0, standardized by the OpenID Foundation in the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification ([OpenID Foundation][2]). It defines how to obtain a **ID Token**—a signed JWT containing user claims (e.g., `sub`, `email`, `name`)—and how to verify its authenticity and integrity ([OpenID Foundation][3]).

#### Key Features

* **ID Token**: A JSON Web Token that cryptographically proves user authentication ([OpenID Foundation][7]).
* **UserInfo Endpoint**: Allows clients to retrieve additional profile claims about the user over OAuth-protected REST ([OpenID Foundation][3]).
* **Discovery**: Automatic endpoint discovery via `/.well-known/openid-configuration` ([OpenID Foundation][3]).
* **PKCE**: Proof Key for Code Exchange is supported to secure the Authorization Code Flow against interception ([Kong Inc.][8]).

#### Standard Flows

1. **Authorization Code Flow**: Recommended for web and mobile apps; exchanges a code for tokens.
2. **Implicit Flow**: (Now discouraged) returns tokens directly in the browser.
3. **Hybrid Flow**: Combines code and tokens for flexibility. ([Okta][9]).

### What Is OpenID?

OpenID is the **original** decentralized authentication protocol established by the OpenID Foundation in 2007 ([OpenID Foundation][10]). Users create an identifier (a URL or XRI) with any OpenID-compliant IDP and then log in to participating sites (relying parties) without sharing passwords ([OpenID Foundation][4]).

#### Evolution

* **OpenID 1.0/1.1 (2005–2006)**: Introduced HTML-based discovery and user-agent redirects.
* **OpenID 2.0 (2007)**: Added XRDS-based discovery (Yadis), attribute exchange, and stronger security modes ([OpenID Foundation][4]).
* **OpenID Connect (2014)**: A third-generation protocol built on OAuth 2.0, offering JWT-based tokens and standardized flows ([OpenID Foundation][2]).

### How They Relate

* **OAuth 2.0 = Authorization**: Grants access to resources via access tokens.
* **OpenID Connect = Authentication + Authorization**: Leverages OAuth 2.0 flows to authenticate users and issue ID Tokens alongside access tokens ([SuperTokens][11]).
* **Classic OpenID = Authentication Only**: A completely separate protocol predating OAuth 2.0, focused solely on verifying user identity across sites ([Wikipedia][5]).

### Benefits of Combining These Standards

* **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Users sign in once with a trusted provider (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Okta) ([OpenID Foundation][12], [Okta Developer][13]).
* **Interoperability:** RESTful JSON APIs work across web, mobile, and single-page applications ([OpenID Foundation][3]).
* **Security Best Practices:** Signed/encrypted tokens, PKCE, standardized discovery, and scopes limit exposure ([OpenID Foundation][7], [Kong Inc.][8]).
* **Extensibility:** Custom claims and scopes allow tailoring for specific business needs ([OpenID Foundation][14]).

### Conclusion

Understanding OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and OpenID is crucial for designing robust authentication and authorization in modern applications. OAuth 2.0 provides the foundational authorization framework, OpenID Connect adds an interoperable authentication layer via ID Tokens, and classic OpenID laid the groundwork for decentralized SSO. By leveraging these standards—and the rich ecosystem of libraries and providers—you can implement secure, scalable identity solutions that meet diverse platform requirements.
